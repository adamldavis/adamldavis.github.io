<p>Great news everyone! </p>

<p>I can now announce, <a src="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221167">Learning Groovy</a> is
	available for pre-order on Apress!
	They have been great to work with and it is much improved from the original version due to their
	feedback and the technical editor.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://leanpub.com/modernjavasecondedition">Modern Java: Second Edition</a> is available in
	beta-mode on Leanpub! This book joins together my original
	Modern Java book, with all of the stuff on Java 8 and some new stuff will be coming soon!
</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve launched <a src="//groocss.org">GrooCSS</a>, a little pet project of mine. More to come on this later. Check it out!</p>
