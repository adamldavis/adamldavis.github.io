In case you didn’t know, I’ve been working on
https://leanpub.com/modernjavasecondedition/[Modern Java: 2nd Edition]
 for more than a year now. Over that time I’ve decided to
add Java 9 and cover more libraries and frameworks like Hibernate and
RxJava. I’ve also fleshed out some existing sections more fully.
After many distractions and other projects getting in the way,
I finally feel like I’m coming close to finishing it!  It’s now
more of a full introduction to Java and the Java ecosystem from
features of Java 8 and 9 all the way to testing, building, web
frameworks, reactive streams, and a lot more.
