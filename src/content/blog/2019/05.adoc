As I've mentioned I've been working on courses on Leanpub.
I'm happy to announce that the first one is complete!

It has changed a lot since my initial thought process.
Among other things, it has a new subtitle,
"Go from beginner to expert Groovy Programmer with Groovy 3.0 and Gradle 5".
I decided that it needed more specifics than "just Groovy" and Gradle
is a popular build tool and a good reason to start learning Groovy.
Check it out: https://leanpub.com/c/learninggroovy3["Groovy 3 Course"].

In case you're curious, this course contains tons of new material
and is not simply a copy of _Learning Groovy 3_ - far from it.
It could be seen as a companion but covers more of some topics and less of others.

I've also decided to launch it with a very low introduction price.
I want the barrier to entry to be very low.
Please share it someone you think might benefit from it if not yourself.
As always, all feedback is welcome (adamd @ this website).
Let me know what you'd like to see more about or less about.

Due to other projects I'm working on, I'm going to postpone for now
working on https://leanpub.com/c/advancedgroovycourse["Advanced Groovy"]
(I hope to cover not just advanced Groovy but also some other projects
in greater detail).
I have a lot going on (including yet another second edition book) but I hope
to get to it eventually.
